  <tr>
    <td class="old-table first-column">If you know the height and width of both the element to be centered and its parent element (and those measurements won't change, i.e. not fluid width environment) one foolproof way to center the element is just to absolute position it with pixel values so it looks perfectly centered.
Let's say you know the exact width and height of the element you are centering, but the parent element can change in height and width. </td>
    <td class="old-table second-column">CSS tables might be fine for you. Or it might not. Tables do render a bit differently than just a regular block-level div does. For instance the 100% width thing. A table will only stretch to be as wide as it needs to for the content inside it whereas by default a block level element will expand to the width of its parent automatically. Also, god help you if you need other content inside that div that you want to position or otherwise not act as a table-cell.</td>
    <td class="old-table third-column">I'd like to tell you the ghost element technique is way better and should be the go-to centering technique for the ages. But in reality, it's just about the same as the table trick. The browser support for this is essentially everything and IE 8+. IE 7 doesn't support pseudo elements. But it doesn't support CSS tables either, so it's a horse apiece. If IE = 7 support is needed, it's table time (or use an equally un-semantic span or something for the ghost element).</td>
